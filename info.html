      to house the tomb of his favorite wife of three, Mumtaz Mahal.The
      Construction was completed in 1653 and employed around 20,000 artisans
      under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
      The domed marble tomb is part of an integrated complex consisting of
      gardens and two red-sandstone buildings surrounded by a crenellated wall
      on three sides. The Taj Mahal is regarded by many as the best example of
      Mughal architecture and is widely recognized as “the jewel of Muslim art
      in India”. It is one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a
      symbol of India’s rich history. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in
      1983, the Taj Mahal attracts some 3 million visitors a year.

      Sultan. Hyder Ali commenced its construction within the walls of the
      Bangalore Fort, and it was completed during the reign of Tipu Sultan in
      1791. After Tipu Sultan’s death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the
      British Administration used the palace for its Secretariat before moving
      to Attara Kacheri in 1868. Today The Archaeology Survey of India maintains
      the palace, which is located at the centre of Old Bangalore near
      Kalasipalyam bus stand, as a tourist spot.
